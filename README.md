Project summary.
The streamer tracker project is a program designed to fetch and present information to the user about specified streamers on two platforms, 
Twitch and YouTube. By using the API’s of both platforms, this project will let users search for streamers, view their live stream statuses, 
and grab data about recent streams, videos, clips, and general streamer data. For iteration 1, 
our main objective is establishing a foundation for the features that allow for searching of streamers and the retrieval of basic information about them.
