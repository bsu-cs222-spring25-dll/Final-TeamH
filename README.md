# Streamer Tracker Project

## Project Summary:

The streamer tracker project is a program designed to fetch and present information to the user about specified streamers on two platforms, 
Twitch and YouTube. By using the APIâ€™s of both platforms, this project will let users search for streamers, view their live stream statuses, 
and grab data about recent streams, videos, clips, and general streamer data. 

For **iteration 1**, our main objective is establishing a foundation for the features that allow for searching of streamers and the retrieval of basic information about them.

## Needed Build Instructions:

This project runs from gradle on IntelliJ but the main program will work in most java cases.

This build depends on API's and a stable network connection.
